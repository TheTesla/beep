 All options have default values, meaning that just typing '\fBbeep\fR' will work.  If an option is specified more than once on the command line, subsequent options override their predecessors.  So '\fBbeep\fR \-f 200 \-f 300' will beep at 300Hz.
 .SH OPTIONS
 .TP
+\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
+enable debug output. This option prints a line like the following before each
+beep:

+[DEBUG] 5 times 200 ms beeps (100 delay between, 0 delay after) @ 1000.00 Hz
+.TP
+\fB\-e\fR device, \fB\-\-device\fR device
+use device as event device. If the switch isn't used, /dev/tty0 and /dev/vc/0 are tried in turn.
+.TP
 \fB\-f\fR N
 beep at N Hz, where 0 < N < 20000.  As a general ballpark, the regular terminal beep is around 750Hz.  N is not, incidentally, restricted to whole numbers.

 When using -c mode, I recommend using a short -D, and a shorter -l, so that the beeps don't blur together.  Something like this will get you a cheesy 1970's style beep-as-you-type-each-letter effect
