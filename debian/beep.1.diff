 All options have default values, meaning that just typing '\fBbeep\fR' will work.  If an option is specified more than once on the command line, subsequent options override their predecessors.  So '\fBbeep\fR \-f 200 \-f 300' will beep at 300Hz.

 When using -c mode, I recommend using a short -D, and a shorter -l, so that the beeps don't blur together.  Something like this will get you a cheesy 1970's style beep-as-you-type-each-letter effect
