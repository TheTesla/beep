#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"beep must be run as root since it needs to access the speaker hardware. "
"There are several posibilities to make the program usable:  Either only for "
"root (no suid bit at all), executable only by users of the group audio, or "
"usable for all."

"Because each program that is suid root is security risk this is not done by "
"default.  However, the program is quite small (~150 lines of code) and is "
"fairly easy to verify the safety of the code yourself, if you don't trust my "
"judgement."
