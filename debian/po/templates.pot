"beep must be run as root since it needs to access the speaker hardware. "
"There are several posibilities to make the program usable:  Either only for "
"root (no suid bit at all), executable only by users of the group audio, or "
"usable for all."

"Since each program set as suid root can be a security risk this is not done "
"by default.  However, the program is quite small (~150 lines of code), so it "
"is fairly easy to verify the safety of the code yourself, if you don't trust "
"my judgement."
