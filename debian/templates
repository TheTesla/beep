Type: select
_Choices: suid root for all, suid root with only group audio executable, not suid at all
Default: suid root with only group audio executable
_Description: How do you want to handle suid root for the beep program?
 beep must be run as root since it needs to access the speaker hardware.
 There are several posibilities to make the program usable:  Either only
 for root (no suid bit at all), executable only by users of the group
 audio, or usable for all.
 .
 Since each program set as suid root can be a security risk this is not done
 by default.  However, the program is quite small (~150 lines of code), so it
 is fairly easy to verify the safety of the code yourself, if you don't
 trust my judgement.
