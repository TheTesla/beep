Default: suid root with only group audio executable
_Description: How to handle suid root for beep program?
 beep must be run as root since it needs to access the speaker hardware.
 There are several posibilities to make the program usable:  Either only
 for root (no suid bit at all), executable only by users of the group
 audio, or usable for all.
 .
 Because each program that is suid root is security risk this is not done
 by default.  However, the program is quite small (~150 lines of code) and
 is fairly easy to verify the safety of the code yourself, if you don't
 trust my judgement.
